# Worker Prompt Template

## Context

Read the roadmap, recent commits, and the current task.

## Objective

Implement exactly one bounded task from Phase 2 of the roadmap.

## Allowed Scope

- `src/` (except `src/main.tsx`)
- `src/lib/` helpers (firestore.ts, storage.ts, auth.ts, publicShares.ts)
- `src/__tests__/` (new test files)
- `src/App.css` (CSS improvements)

## Forbidden Scope

- `src/main.tsx` (entry point — do not modify)
- `commands/` (PowerShell scripts — do not modify)
- `firestore.rules`, `storage.rules` (require human approval)
- `package.json` deps (no new npm packages without human approval)
- Firebase deploy commands
- Secrets and credentials

## Requirements

- Keep diff ≤ 150 lines.
- Run `npm run build && npm run lint` before finishing.
- Prefer adding tests when touching `src/lib/` files.
- Report follow-up items as comments, not additional code.

## Output Format

- Summary of what changed
- Changed files list
- Commands run and results
- Known issues or limitations
- Suggested next task
